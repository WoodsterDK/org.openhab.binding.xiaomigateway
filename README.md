# org.openhab.binding.xiaomigateway

This binding brings Xiaomi Gateway Smart Home devices (Aqara) integration with OpenHAB1.x
Currently only one gateway is supported and only getting sub device state/reading events confirmed to be working. 
Controlling of gateway light works too (only On/Off, no color change within OpenHAB yet)
Unfortunately I have no switch to test controlling its state using write command, but write key generation based on gateway token seems to be implemented OK.

Based on info found here: https://github.com/louisZL/lumi-gateway-local-api

___You need to enable developer mode in Mi Home app (both Android/iOS versions work) !!!___
Please see https://github.com/fooxy/homeassistant-aqara/wiki/Enable-dev-mode

# build
copy __org.openhab.binding.xiaomigateway__ directory to __binding__ directory of OpenHAB source code (https://github.com/openhab/openhab)

build using maven (mvn clean install)

# install
~~copy gson-2.3.1.jar to addons directory of OpenHAB (search internet or download here: http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.3.1/gson-2.3.1.jar)~~

copy target file __org.openhab.binding.xiaomigateway*.jar__ to __addons__ directory of OpenHAB distribution

# usage
The binding detects a Xiaomi gateway on local network and lists all sub devices. For example:
```
