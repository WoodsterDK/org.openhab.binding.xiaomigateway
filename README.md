# org.openhab.binding.xiaomigateway

Currently only one gateway is supported and only getting sub device state/reading events is supported.
Unfortunatelly I have no switch to test controlling its state using write command.

# build
copy __org.openhab.binding.xiaomigateway__ directory to __binding__ directory of OpenHAB source code (https://github.com/openhab/openhab)

build using maven (mvn clean install)

# install
copy __gson-2.3.1.jar__ to __addons__ directory of OpenHAB (search internet or download here: http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.3.1/gson-2.3.1.jar)

copy target file __org.openhab.binding.xiaomigateway*__.jar__ to __addons__ directory of OpenHAB distribution

# usage
The binding detects Xiaomi gateway on local network and list all sub devices. For example:
```

```

sid is a sub device identificator used in item configuration file.
possible values are: magnet, temperature, humidity, virtual_switch (button simulates ON/OFF switch), click, long_click, double_click

#openhab.cfg
No configuration needed
